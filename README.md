## General Features

Users can login with their separate accounts and can rely on the security of storing their personal notes without others getting it. Passwords can be changed if the user forgets it or somehow others come to know about the password. Notes are saved on firebase, clearing out on-device storage issues. Users experience a dark material UI with subtle colors that don't uncomfort the eyes.
